The client is an agent for health conference speakers, who manages about 200 womenâ€™s health speakers. Her speakers need to rapidly re-align their marketing to deal with the changes in our economy due to the Coronavirus. She needs a way to showcase her speakers' ability to teach and entertain in a virtual environment.

I created a virtual-experiences post-type and coded a video post format for it, which automatically picks the first video she adds to the post, and uses it on the post archive page, so she could create new pages quickly without much of a learning curve, since there are so many other new things she needs to learn at this period in time. The archive page needed to display the videos in a format that is easily browsable. In addition, I wanted the archive page to be modern and attractive at all screen sizes, while fitting seamlessly into her website's theme design
